# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for improving the security of our project. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing [angelo.zambrano.1990@gmail.com].

To ensure the safety of our users, we ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## What to Expect

Once you have reported a vulnerability, we will follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability report within 2 business days.
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and verify the reported vulnerability.
3. **Resolution**: We will develop and implement a fix for the vulnerability. This may include updating documentation, issuing a patch, or other measures as necessary.
4. **Communication**: We will communicate the fix and, if appropriate, publicly disclose the vulnerability along with credits to the reporter.

We aim to resolve security issues as quickly as possible while ensuring a thorough and effective fix.

## Disclosure Policy

We are committed to transparency in our security practices. Once a vulnerability is resolved, we will:

- Publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability, the impact, and the steps taken to resolve it.
- Credit the individual or team who reported the vulnerability, if they wish to be acknowledged.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
